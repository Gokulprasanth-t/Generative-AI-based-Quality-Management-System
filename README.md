# Generative-AI-based-Quality-Management-System
Generative AI-based Quality Management System (QMS) specifically designed for airline travel call centres.
<hr>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
The project was created as a web application for a Quality Management System (QMS) based on Generative AI, especially intended for contact centers handling airline reservations. Using the generative AI powers of the Lyzr AI API, this system will process call recordings in order to examine call center operations. It will concentrate on transcription of audio files and the extraction of significant insights from these transcriptions.
